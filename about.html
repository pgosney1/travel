         <p>Patrick Gosney is a student at Harrty S Truman City College in Chicago, IL. He was born in the southwest suburbs to first generation Irish American Margaret Finnegan. He was named after his great grandfather, Patrick Finnegan. Although she is no longer with us, Patrick loved speaking with his grandmother who emigrated to the United States in the 1950's.</p>
    <p>Patrick chose to write about Dublin as a vacation spot because he would like to visit Ireland soon. He has a strong relationship with his family who still live in the country; they visit the United States regularly and stay with his extended family. Patrick loves being Irish and learning more about the country's eventful history.</p>
