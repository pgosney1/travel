         <h2>History of Dublin, Ireland</h2>
         <p>On the east coast in the province of Leinster, Dublin sits at the Irish Sea. Acting as the center of the country's commercial power, this port city also acts as the center of culture for Ireland. Writers, poets, and scholars seek the city for its inspiring nature and bountiful craic - a term unique to Ireland to describe the population's sense of humor and general disposition</p>
         <p>This city full of Irish charm was not established easily, however. Dublin has long been the center of conflict, from Norse and Irish battles, to civil wars and rebellions against England. Below you will find a table detailing a brief history of the Irish Civil War.</p>
